# Decentralized Insurance Protocol

## Project Description

The Decentralized Insurance Protocol is a blockchain-based smart contract system that enables users to purchase insurance policies and submit claims in a trustless, transparent manner. Built on Ethereum using Solidity, this protocol eliminates traditional insurance intermediaries by automating policy management and claim processing through smart contracts.

The system allows users to purchase various types of insurance policies by paying premiums in ETH, submit claims when incidents occur, and receive automated payouts upon claim approval. All transactions and policy data are stored immutably on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and reducing the potential for fraud.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize insurance by creating a decentralized, transparent, and accessible insurance ecosystem that:

- **Eliminates Intermediaries**: Remove traditional insurance companies and their associated overhead costs
- **Ensures Transparency**: All policies, claims, and payouts are recorded on the blockchain for public verification
- **Reduces Fraud**: Immutable blockchain records and smart contract automation minimize fraudulent activities
- **Global Accessibility**: Provide insurance services to anyone with an internet connection and cryptocurrency wallet
- **Automated Processes**: Streamline policy management and claim processing through smart contract automation
- **Community Governance**: Eventually transition to a DAO model where token holders govern protocol decisions

## Key Features

### üèõÔ∏è **Policy Management**
- Purchase insurance policies with customizable coverage amounts and durations

- Automatic policy activation and expiration tracking
- User-friendly policy lookup and management interface

### üí∞ **Premium Pool System**
- Collective premium pool that funds approved claims
- Transparent pool balance tracking
- Risk-based premium calculation (coverage limited to 10x premium amount)
- Automated fund management and distribution

### üìã **Claims Processing**
- Simple claim submission process with detailed descriptions
- Policy validation before claim acceptance

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- Hardhat or Truffle framework
- MetaMask or compatible Web3 wallet
- Test ETH for deployment and testing

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd decentralized-insurance-protocol

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run tests
npx hardhat test

# Deploy to testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

### Usage
1. Deploy the contract to your preferred network
2. Users can purchase policies by calling `purchasePolicy()` with ETH
3. Policyholders can submit claims using `submitClaim()`
4. Contract owner can approve/reject claims via `processClaim()`
5. Monitor all activities through emitted events

**Note**: This is a prototype implementation. Conduct thorough security audits before deploying to mainnet with real funds.
